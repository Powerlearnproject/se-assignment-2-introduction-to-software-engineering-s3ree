# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
ANSWER: Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintainence of high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
ANSWER: Software Engineering is a discipline that intergrates principles and practices to ensure developmant of high quality sotware. It differs from traditional programming as traditional programming has narrower activity interms of methodology and long term maintainence

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
ANSWER:
-Requirements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
-Design: creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture 
-Implementation: writing code and building software with the ddesign specifications
-Testing: carrying out tests to ensure the software meets quality standards 
-Deployment: releasing software to users
-Maintainence: providing ongoing support and updates to the software after deploying it

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
ANSWER: Waterfall uses a sequential approach with distinct phases that flow downwards while agile uses an incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change
Waterfall is best suited for projects that have unchanging requirements,  whereas agile is used in projects that require flexibilityand are expected to evolve over time

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

ANSWER: Requirements engineering is the gathering and documenting of user needs and system requirements. It is important in ensuring that the final software product aligns with user needs.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
ANSWER: Lenovo defines modularity as dividing a system into separate modules or components. It improves maintainability and scalability by allowing users to focus on individual modules thus facilitating easier debugging.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
ANSWER: 
Unit testing is the process where you test the smallest functional unit code.
Integration testing is where components of the software are gradually integrated and then tested as unified group.
System testing is testing the complete system to ensure that it meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance testing is software testing that evaluates whether a system meets its business and user requirements.
Testing ensures software systems function correctly, are secure and provide value to end users.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
ANSWER: Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. An example of this is Git which has features such as easier branching, supports collaboration and has distributed development.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
ANSWER: A project manager is responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
Key responsibilities include defining clear objectives and scope, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations. They oversee resource allocation, budget management as well as setting realistic timelines.
Some of the challenges project managers may face are tight deadlines, as pressure to deliver software projects on schedule may result in rushed development and compromised quality.Technical debt may also occur as a result of under-budgeting or shortcuts which impede future development efforts and increases maintainence costs.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
ANSWER: Software maintenance is the process of modifying and updating software applications after their initial deployment to correct faults, improve performance or adapt to a changed environment.It is essential for delivering high quality software products that meet user needs, adhere to budget constraints as well as maintain compatibility with evolvong technology platforms.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
ANSWER: Software engineers may face issues related to data privacy and security. They must ensure that the data they deal with complies with relevant privacy laws and regulations.Another issue involves creation and deployment of software that impacts society.They have to consider the consequences of their work such as spreading of misinformation or even job displacement. 
They can ensure they adhere to ethical standards by following established codes of ethics.They should as well priortise transparency, honesty and integrity in work.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
